# Text-language-recognition
Hello!
This program helps you to find out whether the entered text is mostly English or Farsi.
First, the program asks you to enter a text and you enter a text.
If most of the letters and numbers in the Persian text, the program says that the text is dominant or the whole text is Persian.
But if most of the letters and numbers of the text were English, the program says that the text is dominant or the whole text is English.
If the number of Persian and English letters and numbers are equal, the program says that the number of English and Persian letters in the text is equal. 
At the end, the percentage of Farsi and English words in the text is shown.
I hope you liked itðŸ˜Š
